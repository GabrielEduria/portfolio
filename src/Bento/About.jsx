          A CS student based in Asia, I use React to build clean web app
          for brands, startups, and businesses. I like to improve and learn something new 
          every day, and I find real satisfaction in building and designing things I enjoy.
        </p>

          When I'm not coding, I enjoy brewing coffee, hitting the gym, and staying active with basketball and other things.  
          If I'm not working out or keeping up with UFC, you'll find me spending time with my dog, Chonsi.
