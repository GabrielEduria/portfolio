      A CS student with real-world experience in mobile app development 
      and a strong passion for building clean, modern web applications. 
      I specialize in using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS to create fast, 
      responsive, and scalable websites. I enjoy turning ideas into polished 
      digital solutions, constantly learning new tools and technologies to 
      improve every project I work on.

        Outside of coding, I enjoy coffee, hitting the gym, and staying active 
        through basketball and MMA. When I’m not working out or following sports,
         I’m usually spending time with my dog, Chonsi.
