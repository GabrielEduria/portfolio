      A CS student with real-world experience in mobile app development and a strong passion for building clean, modern web applications. I specialize in using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS to create fast, responsive, and scalable websites. I enjoy turning ideas into polished digital solutions, constantly learning new tools and technologies to improve every project I work on.

          Outside of coding, I love coffee and spending time at the gym. 
          I’m passionate about basketball and MMA, which keep me active 
          and motivated. When I’m not working out or following sports, I 
          enjoy hanging out with my dog, Chonsi, who keeps life fun and relaxed.
