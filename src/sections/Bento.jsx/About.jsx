          I’m a computer science student specializing in front-end development, 
          where I focus on transforming ideas into visually appealing and highly 
          functional web experiences. I work with modern technologies like Next.js 
          to create everything from sleek landing pages and personal portfolios to 
          full-scale web applications. I thrive on collaborating with clients to 
          ensure their vision is realized, while also making sure the design is 
          fast, responsive, and user-friendly, ultimately helping them achieve 
          their goals and leave a lasting impact.

           I also coach beginners through 8 to 16-week fitness programs, 
           both online and in person—focused on helping them build strength, 
           lose fat, and improve their lifestyle. Each plan is tailored to the 
           individual, combining training, nutrition, and accountability to 
           deliver sustainable results.
