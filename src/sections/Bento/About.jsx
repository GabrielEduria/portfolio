    <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed sm:leading-7 overflow-hidden text-base">
      A CS student with hands-on experience in mobile app development and web technologies.  
      I build clean, modern, and scalable websites using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, focused on modern and responsive design. I’m passionate about turning ideas into polished digital solutions 
      that help businesses grow and users enjoy seamless experiences.

      <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed sm:leading-7 overflow-hidden text-base">
      Outside of coding, I enjoy coffee, hitting the gym, and staying active with basketball and MMA.  
      If I’m not working out or keeping up with sports, you’ll find me spending time with my dog, Chonsi.
