    A CS student looking to gain experience as a Junior Developer,
    I use Next.js + React.Js to build clean, responsive, and user-focused web applications
    that help brands grow from  startups to e-commerce platform by designing
    and providing digital experiences.
    </p>

    <p className="b-3 leading-relaxed sm:leading-7 overflow-hidden text-base">
    Outside of coding, I enjoy brewing coffee, hitting the gym, and staying active with basketball and other things.  
    If I'm not working out or keeping up with UFC, you'll find me spending time with my dog, Chonsi.
