    A CS student eager to gain hands-on experience as a Front-End Developer. 
    I specialize in building clean, responsive, and user-focused web applications 
    using Next.js and React. My goal is to create seamless digital experiences 
    that not only look great but also help businesses grow and solve real-world 
    problems.
    </p>

      Outside of coding, I enjoy coffee, hitting the gym, and staying active with basketball and other things.  
      If I’m not working out or keeping up with NBA, you’ll find me spending time with my dog, Chonsi.
