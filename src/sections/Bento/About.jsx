    A CS student based in Asia, I use React + Next.js to build clean and user-friendly web applications 
     for brands, startups, and businesses. I Bias shipping fast, creating responsive web apps, and helping 
     businesses turn ideas into real results.
    </p>

    <p className="b-3 leading-relaxed sm:leading-7 overflow-hidden text-base">
    Outside of coding, I enjoy brewing coffee, hitting the gym, and staying active with basketball and other things.  
    If I'm not working out or keeping up with UFC, you'll find me spending time with my dog, Chonsi.
