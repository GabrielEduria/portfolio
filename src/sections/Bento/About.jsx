    <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed sm:leading-7 overflow-hidden text-base">
    A CS student eager to gain hands-on experience as a Junior Developer.
    I use Next.js and React to build clean, responsive, and user-focused web applications.
    I help brands grow from emerging startups to established service providers by designing
    seamless digital experiences that not only look great but also solve real-world problems.
    </p>


      <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed sm:leading-7 overflow-hidden text-base">
      Outside of coding, I enjoy coffee, hitting the gym, and staying active with basketball and other things.  
      If I’m not working out or keeping up with UFC, you’ll find me spending time with my dog, Chonsi.
